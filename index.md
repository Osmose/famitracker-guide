# A Slightly Better FamiTracker Guide

You want to make chiptunes? Played Shovel Knight and think you're the next virt? Do you still play emulated NES games out of more than a misdirected nostalgia for a time when someone chose your clothes for you?

Whatever your answer, we have great news: You can be chiptunes musician! We're glad you're here.

This guide describes how to use FamiTracker, a program for making NES-compatible music. We'll cover the basics of FamiTracker itself, plus terminology and techniques that have been developed by the community around it.

What we won't be covering is how to _compose_ music; we're not here to dictate your creative process or give you the secret to making soul-shattering bangers. But the path to those starts here!
